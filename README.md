# Learning NodeJS, Express, Swig and MongoDB with APIs served on Top

I am learning how to utilize APIs, building an interactive website
that allows for basic GET requests to display data in a bootstrapified way.

### So far I have:

- coindesk.com
- shapeshift.io

### I have plans to add:

- google url shortener
- google translate
- urban dictionary
- sentiment analysis
- yelp
- accuweather - use wind speed to move css element(?)
- many others

I will add on more features incrementally as I get a better grasp of the foundational concepts.

- MongoDB vs postgresql vs Couchdb?
- angular 2
- reactjs
- webpack
- gulp
- template engines
- Auth0 vs Passport
- JWT
- webtask
- websockets vs xmpp.websockets (private chat server)
- node encryption
- oppenssl encryption
